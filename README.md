All models should work as long as they are in `.glb` or `.vrm` format. `.gltf` has not been tested but might work. `.scn` files created with Godot should all import correctly as well.

## Available renderers
* [OpenSeeFace](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace)

## Prerequisites (Linux only)
* Python 3.6 - Python 3.9 (at time of writing, `onnxruntime` isn't compatible with Python 3.10)
* `python3-pip` and `python3-venv` are installed

## Quickstart

### Windows
1. Download the latest release
2. Unzip all files into a directory (do not move any of the files)
3. Run the `.exe` on Windows
4. Start the facetracker from within the application

### Linux
1. Download the latest release
2. Unzip all files into a directory (do not move any of the files)
3. Run `chmod +x <binary name>` in a terminal to make the binary executable
4. Run the binary
5. Start the facetracker from within the application

## Building from source
1. TODO
