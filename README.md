All models should work as long as they are in `.glb` or `.vrm` format. `.gltf` has not been tested but might work. `.scn` files created with Godot should all import correctly as well.

## Available trackers
* [OpenSeeFace](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace)

*more trackers may be available in the future, such as [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/)*

## Quickstart

### Windows
1. Download the latest release
2. Unzip all files into a directory (do not move any of the files)
3. Run the `.exe` on Windows
4. Start the facetracker from within the application

### Linux

### Flatpak
1. Ensure that [Flathub is enabled on your system](https://flatpak.org/setup/)
2. Using a graphical interface that supports Flatpak, search for "virtual puppet project"
   1. Alternatively, you can use `flatpak install vpuppr` to list any apps that have the same string
   * VPupPr will be available under the name `com.github.virtual_puppet_project.vpuppr`
   * For the latest (alpha, beta) builds of VPupPr, you can download them from [Flathub Beta](https://beta.flathub.org/)
4. Hit the install button and run it just like any other app!


### (using binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/vpuppr/releases))
1. Download the latest release
2. Unzip all files into a directory (do not move any of the files)
3. Run `chmod +x <binary names>` in a terminal to make the app binaries executable.
   1. Do this for `vpuppr.x86_64` and `resources/extensions/open_see_face/OpenSeeFaceFolder/OpenSeeFace/facetracker`
4. Run the binary
5. Start the facetracker from within the application


## Building from source
1. Clone or download this repository at the appropriate tag (or `master` for the latest commit)
2. Download a precompiled Godot editor binary from the [virtual-puppet-project's Godot fork](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/godot/releases)
   1. If you would rather compile the engine yourself, please see [the section on compiling the Godot fork](#building-the-godot-fork)
3. Download a precompiled Godot release template from the same repository in step 2
4. Run the custom Godot editor and open your local copy of `vpuppr` with the editor
5. Follow the [Godot instructions for exporting a project](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_projects.html) and use the custom templates downloaded from step 3 instead of the default templates
6. Next to your resulting binary, copy the `resources` folder next to it. The `resources` folder is read at runtime

## Building the Godot fork
0. Make sure you have the following tools installed and available on your `PATH` if applicable:
   * `git`
   * `python3` (preferably version 3.10+)
   * [All the tools needed for compiling Godot](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/development/compiling/introduction_to_the_buildsystem.html)
   * A `bash`-compatible prompt. Git Bash comes preinstalled with Git for Windows
1. Clone the following utility repositories:
   1. [The virtual-puppet-project fork of Godot](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/godot)
   2. [godot-module-applier](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/godot-module-applier)
   3. [godot-build-scripts](https://github.com/virtual-puppet-project/godot-build-scripts)
2. Your directory structure should look like
   * ./
       * godot/
       * godot-module-applier/
       * godot-build-scripts/
3. Inside of the `godot/` directory, run `cp ../godot-module-applier/applier.py .` to copy the `applier.py` script into the `godot/` directory
4. Inside of the `godot/` directory, run `python3 applier.py apply`. This will pull in and apply all modules, third-party sources, and patches to Godot
5. Inside of the `godot/` directory, run `cp ../godot-build-scripts/build-* .` to copy all build scripts into the `godot/` directory
6. Inside of the `godot/` directory, to build various versions of the editor do:
   * Editor: `./build-editor.sh`
   * Release template: `./build-normal-template.sh`
7. The compiled Godot binary will be available in the `godot/` directory under the `bin/` directory

These instructions are probably more fit for the Godot fork, than here.
